# Introduction
In this project we look at implementing the JPEG compression algorithm used in many images we see online. We see how different compression ratios affect an image and the noise around salient features of an image. Many images use JPEG as you can reduce the file size of an image greatly while still keeping many of the salient features intact.

# Main Project

## 1. Intro

In this lab we are implementing the JPEG algorithm used for image compression. We do this so that images can be transferred and stored efficiently and to save space. Uncompressed images are very difficult to store, so storing these images digitally is very advantageous.

We are using an encoding/decoding algorithm in order to achieve compression on luminance (gray-level) images. The main part of this lab is using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to describe an image using a smaller set of coefficients to represent the original image. These values are put through a quantization table to decrease the information needed to represent the coefficients created through the DCT. Then we decode the information from these steps to get a new image that is compressed that uses less space than the original picture. 

## 2. The JPEG Compression Algorithm 

To implement the JPEG compression algorithm we start by taking the forward and inverse DCT. To implement the forward DCT the original image is divided into non overlapping blocks size 8x8. Each block gets transformed using the 2D DCT expressed as,

![Equation51]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-1.PNG)

where C<sub>v</sub> follows the same rule as C<sub>u</sub> and

![Equation52]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-2.PNG)

These coefficients are an approximation and do introduce distortion and slight loss in image quality. 

![Equation53]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-3.PNG)

	Assignment:
	1. Write the MATLAB function dctmgr that implements 
	the following functionality:
		(a) it takes a luminacnce (grey-level) image
		as an input, divides it into non overlapping
		8 x 8 blocks, and DCT transforms each block
		accoring to the 2D DCT. 
		(b) The DCT coefficients for the entire image are
		returned into a matrix coeff of size 64 x 
		N<sub>blocks</sub>, where N<sub>blocks</sub> is the number of 8x8 blocks
		inside the image. 
		(c) For a given block b, the coefficients of the 
		column coeff(:,b) are organized according
		to the zig-zag order shown in Fig. 3. That is, 
		coeff(2,b) = F(1,2), coeff(3,b) = F(2,1), coeff(3,b) = F(3,1), ...
		(d) The zero-frequency "DC" coefficients, F(1,1), 
		for each block are encoded using differential encoding
		(i.e each DC coefficient is predicted either 0
		if it is the start of a new row, or by the
		DC coefficient of the block to its left). As
		an example:
		coeff(1,1) = F<sub>1</sub>(1,1) - 0, 
		coeff(1,2) = F<sub>2</sub>(1,1) - F<sub>1</sub>(1,1),
		coeff(1,3) = F<sub>3</sub>(1,1) - F<sub>2</sub>(1,1),
		...
		where F<sub>i</sub>(1,1) is the zero frequency DCT
		coefficient of block i. Image blocks should be 
		processed in a left-to-right and top-to-bottom order.
		When starting each new row of 8-by-8 blocks, the 
		predictor of the DC coeffiecient is reset to 0 (in
		other words, don't use the last block of one row to
		predict the first block of the following row). 
	2. Write the MATLAB function idctmgr that implements the 
	following functionality. 
		(a) It takes a matrix coeff of size 64 x N<sub>blocks</sub>, 
		where N<sub>blocks</sub> is the number of 8 x 8 blocks inside the
		image and reconstructs a luminance image. 
		(b) For each block b, the coefficients in the column
		coeff(:,b) are used to reconstruct the block according to the
		reconstructed DCT equation. You should write an inverse
		2-D DCT routine using matrix multiplication. Keep in mind
		that you have to undo the prediction used for the DC coefficients
		to recover their true values. 

1) The function dctmgr is shown below:

```
function [coefficients, temp] = dctmgr(image, lossFactor) 
%dctmgr Creates JPEG coefficients for an image 
%Takes a luminance (gray-level) image as an input, divives it into 
%non overlapping 8x8 blocks, and uses the DCT transform on each block according 
%F(u,v) = 1/4*C_u*C_v sum(f(x,y)*cos(((2x+1)*u*pi)/16) * %cos(((2y+1)*v*pi)/16), u,v = 0,...,7. For a given block b, 
%the coefficients of the column coefficients(:,b) are organized in a  
%zig-zag pattern. The zero-frequency coefficients, F(1,1), for each block 
%is encoded using differential encoding: coefficients(1,1) = F_1(1,1); 
%coefficients(1,2) = F_2(1,1) - F_1(1,1); where F_i(1,1) is the zero 
%frequency DCT coefficient of block i   
[x,y] = size(image); 
index = 1; 
coefficients = zeros(64,x*8); 
dctMatrix = zeros(x,y); 
for x2 = 1:8:x     
	for y2 = 1:8:y         
		temp = image(x2:x2+7,y2:y2+7);         
		firstDct = dct2(temp);         
		firstDct = quantization(firstDct,lossFactor);         
		dctMatrix(x2:x2+7,y2:y2+7) = firstDct;         
		%coefficient matrix:         
		coefficients(:,index) = zigZag(firstDct);         
		index = index + 1;     
	end 
end 
temp = coefficients(1,:); 
for i = 2:y*8     
	coefficients(1,i) = temp(1,i) - temp(1,i-1); 
end
end
```

2. The function idctmgr is included below:

```
function [output] = idctmgr(coefficientMatrix,temp,lossFactor)
%(a) It takes a matrix coeff of size 64 x Nblocks, where Nblocks is the number of 8 x 8 blocks 
% inside the image and reconstruct a luminance image. 
% (b) For each given block b, the coefficients in the column coeff(:,b) are used to reconstruct 
% the block according to (3). 
firstiDct = zeros(8,8); 
output = zeros(512,512); 
[x,y] = size(coefficientMatrix); 
coefficientMatrix(1,:) = temp; 
index = 1;          
for x2 = 1:8:505              
	for y2 = 1:8:505                  
		firstiDct = inverseZigZag(coefficientMatrix(:,index));                 
		firstiDct = inverseQuantization(firstiDct,lossFactor);                 
		output(x2:x2+7,y2:y2+7) = idct2(firstiDct);                 
		index = index + 1;              
	end          
end 
end
```

The next step in the JPEG standard is quantization. The effect of the DCT is to create many small coefficients that are close to zero, and a small number of large coefficients. The goal of quantization is to represent a continuum of values with a finite small set of symbols. In JPEG the quantization of the DCT coefficients other than the DC coefficient is performed as follows.  
 
![Equation54]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-4.PNG)

After using the quantization, we take the inverse that is defined by the map 

![Equation55]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-5.PNG)

We notice that by doing this, the compression becomes lossy during the quantization step as it creates many zero coefficients as the loss factor becomes larger. As a result, it becomes possible to spend fewer bits. 

	Assignment:
	3. Implement the quantizer and inverse quantizer as defined above, 
	and integrate it with the DCT and IDCT transforms. 
	4. Using test images, display reconstructed images for loss-factor = 1, 10, and 20. 
	Also display the reconstruction error. 
	5. For the test images, compute the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
	between the original image, and the reconstructed image, 
	
![Equation56]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation5-6.PNG)

	for the values of loss factor in {1, ..., 50}. 
	Plot the values of PSNR as a function of loss-factor.
	
3.  The functions quantization.m and inverseQuantization.m are using to implement this part of the lab and are included below:

quantization.m
```
function [output] = quantization(f_uv,lossFactor) 
%Implement the quantizer 
output = zeros(8,8); 
table_Q = [16 11 10 16 24 40 51 61;             
	   12 12 14 19 26 58 60 55;              
	   14 13 16 24 40 57 69 56;              
	   14 17 22 29 51 87 80 62;              
	   18 22 37 56 68 109 103 77;              
	   24 35 55 64 81 104 113 92;              
	   49 64 78 87 103 121 120 101;              
	   72 92 95 98 112 100 103 99]; 
table_Q = table_Q/255;     
for u = 1:8         
	for v = 1:8             
		output(u,v) = round((f_uv(u,v)./(lossFactor.*table_Q(u,v))));        
	end     
end 
end
```
inverseQuantization.m:
```
function [output] = inverseQuantization(f_uv,lossFactor) 
%Inverse quantization: 
output = zeros(8,8); 
table_Q = [16 11 10 16 24 40 51 61;              
	   12 12 14 19 26 58 60 55;              
	   14 13 16 24 40 57 69 56;             
	   14 17 22 29 51 87 80 62;              
	   18 22 37 56 68 109 103 77;            
	   24 35 55 64 81 104 113 92;              
	   49 64 78 87 103 121 120 101;              
	   72 92 95 98 112 100 103 99];           
table_Q = table_Q/255;    
for u = 1:8         
	for v = 1:8             
		output(u,v) = f_uv(u,v).*lossFactor.*table_Q(u,v);         
	end   
end   
end 
```

4. Below are test images showing loss-factor of 1, 10, and 20 as well as plots of the reconstruction error, where areas that are more yellow signify a larger error.  

![Figure51]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure5-1.PNG)
![Figure52]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure5-2.PNG)
![Figure53]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure5-3.PNG)

5. Below is the PSNR vs. Loss Factor for each of the 6 images. The plots have logarithmic decay as loss factor increases which makes sense as the reconstruction gets worse as the loss factor increases and the PSNR has a factor of log 10 in its calculation. It also makes sense as there is significantly more noise as the reconstruction gets worse which causes the PSNR to decrease which can be seen in the previous graphs for part 4 as loss factor increases.

The next part of the lab involves computing the maximum and minimum values of any DCT coefficient or DC prediction residual can assume. When a quantized coefficient is a zero, the coefficient is not coded. Instead, we count the number of zeros separating the non-zero coefficient from the previous non-zero coefficient, we precede it with a code word that encodes the number of zeros between this coefficient and the previous non-zero coefficients. To achieve this we use arithmetic encoding, and to create the input to the arithmetic encoder we process the image’s coefficients into a triplet of numbers: nZeroes, nBits, and value. These values are based on the DC coefficients of the image and are implemented in the next assignment.  

	Assignment. 
	6. Implement the triplet pre-processor and its corresponding post-processor. 
	The input parameter to the pre-processor should be the 64 x N<sub>blocks</sub> array. 
	The output should be a single vector of signed 16 bit integers, symb. You should 
	store sequentially in symb the values nZeros, nBits, and value for each block to indicate
	to the post-processor where block boundaries lie. All columns of your coefficient array
	are processed into a single layer symb vector. The size of symb will be variable and depend
	on how the loss-factor is chosen. 
		(a) Name your pre-processor function run_bits_value. 
		You will pass to this function your coefficient array,
		and it will return a single vector symb representing
		the entire picture as described above. 
		(b) Name your post-processor function irun_bits_value. 
		You will pass to this function a vector symb
		and it will return a coefficient array
		
6a. Implementation of the pre-processor run_bits_value can be found below:

```
function [symb] = run_bits_value(coefficientMatrix) 
%implement run_bits_value   
nZeros = zeros(64, length(coefficientMatrix)); 
nBits = zeros(64, length(coefficientMatrix));   
zeros_n = 0; 
for i = 1:length(coefficientMatrix)     
	for j = 1:64         
		value = coefficientMatrix(j,i);         
		nZeros(j,i) = -1;         
		if(value == 0)             
			zeros_n = zeros_n + 1;        
		end        
		if j == 1             
			nBits(j,i) = 12;         
		else            
			nBits(j,i) = 11;         
		end     
		end 
	end      
	symbMatrix = zeros(3*64, length(coefficientMatrix));     
	mZeros = zeros(64,length(coefficientMatrix));      
	mBits = zeros(64, length(coefficientMatrix));     
	mCoefficients = zeros(64,length(coefficientMatrix));          
	for i = 1:length(coefficientMatrix)          
		nPresent = 0;          
		for j = 1:64              
			if nZeros(j,i) ~= -1                   
				nPresent = nPresent + 1;                  
				mZeros(nPresent,i) = nZeros(j,i);                 
				mBits(nPresent, i) = mBits(j,i);                 
				mCoefficients(nPresent,i) = mCoefficients(j,i);             
			end          
		end     
	end            
	for i = 1:length(coefficientMatrix)          
		for j = 1:64              
			symbMatrix(1+3*(j-1),i) = mZeros(j,i);              
			symbMatrix(2+3*(j-1),i) = mBits(j,i);              
			symbMatrix(3+3*(j-1),i) = round(mCoefficients(j,i));          
		end      
	end     
	symbVector = zeros(3*64*length(coefficientMatrix),1);      
	numI = 1;     
	for i = 1:length(coefficientMatrix)          
		for j = 1:64*3 -1              
			if symbMatrix(j,i) == 0 && symbMatrix(j+1,i) == 0                  
				symbVector(numI) = 0;                  
				symbVector(numI + 1) = 0;            
				numI = numI +2;                  
				break              
			else                  
				symbVector(numI,1) = symbMatrix(j,i);                 
				numI = numI + 1;             
			end         
		end     
	end           
	numI = 0;      
	for i = 1:length(symbVector) - 3          
		if symbVector(i) == 0 && symbVector(i+1) == 0 && symbVector(i+2) == 0 && symbVector(i+3) == 0              					break;         
		else              
			numI = numI +1;         
		end      
	end      
	symb = symbVector(1:numI); 
end 
```

6b.  Implementation of the post-processor inverse_run_bits_value is below:

```
function [ coefficients ] = inverse_run_bits_value( symb ) 
%%(6) 
blockN = 1; 
start = zeros(4096,1); 
start(1) = 1; %first block starts at 1 
ends(4096) = length(symb); %last block ends at the last symb element 
for i = 3:length(symb)-1 %starting index of every block     
	if symb(i-2) == 0 && symb(i-1) == 0 && symb(i) == 0 %find EOB when three consecutive zeros       
		start(blockN+1) = i;      
		blockN = blockN +1;     
	end
end  
matComp = zeros(64,4096); %compressed matrix, doing decompression 
for i = 1:4095    
	matComp(1:length(symb(start(i):start(i+1)-1)),i) = symb(start(i):start(i+1)-1); 
end 
%handle last entry separately because of bound conditions 
matComp(1:length(symb(start(4096):length(symb))),4096) = 
symb(start(4096):length(symb));    
matUncomp = zeros(64,4096); %uncompressed matrix 
for i = 1:4096    
	ind = 0; %keep track of where the value is     
	for j = 1:3:61 %go in jumps of 3         
		zToSkip = matComp(j,i); %get the number of zeros that need to be placed in between         
		nBits = matComp(j+1,i);         
		val = matComp(j+2,i); %get the value from the triplet  
		ind = ind+zToSkip+1; %new index to place val is the old index+numZeros+1         
		matUncomp(ind,i) = val;    
	end 
end 
coefficients = matUncomp; 
```

After implementing the pre-processor, we go to the arithmetic encoding step by feeding in the symb vector to the arithmetic encoder. This is done in the next assignment.  

	Assignment
	7. Use the MATLAB code provided above to implement the arithmetic encoding/decoding steps. 
	You should be able to pass your coefficient array through your run_bits_value function, 
	arithmetic encode your symb vector, arithmetic decode the bistream created by the
	arithmetic encoder to get a reconstructed symb vector, and then pass this reconstructed symb vector
	through your irun_bits_value function to get a coefficient array that can
	be decoded into a picture by idctmgr. 
	
7. The symb vector was produced from run_bits_value and I put it into the irun_bits_value function, but I did not have time to evaluate the performance of the arithmetic encoder/decoder.  '

## 3. Conclusion

In this lab, by using the DCT and arithmetic encoding and decoding, we were able to implement the JPEG algorithm. It could be seen that with greater loss factors that the image reconstruction becomes worse. By comparing loss factor to the PSNR of the reconstructed images to the original images as well as the compression ratio to the PSNR, we were able to visually see how well reconstruction was for certain loss factors.
