# Introduction
In this project we look at implementing the JPEG compression algorithm used in many images we see online. We see how different compression ratios affect an image and the noise around salient features of an image. Many images use JPEG as you can reduce the file size of an image greatly while still keeping many of the salient features intact.

# Main Project

## 1. Intro

In this lab we are implementing the JPEG algorithm used for image compression. We do this so that images can be transferred and stored efficiently and to save space. Uncompressed images are very difficult to store, so storing these images digitally is very advantageous.

We are using an encoding/decoding algorithm in order to achieve compression on luminance (gray-level) images. The main part of this lab is using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to describe an image using a smaller set of coefficients to represent the original image. These values are put through a quantization table to decrease the information needed to represent the coefficients created through the DCT. Then we decode the information from these steps to get a new image that is compressed that uses less space than the original picture. 

## 2. The JPEG Compression Algorithm 

To implement the JPEG compression algorithm we start by taking the forward and inverse DCT. To implement the forward DCT the original image is divided into non overlapping blocks size 8x8. Each block gets transformed using the 2D DCT expressed as,

where C<sub>v</sub> follows the same rule as C<sub>u</sub> and

These coefficients are an approximation and do introduce distortion and slight loss in image quality.
