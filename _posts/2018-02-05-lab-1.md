## Introduction
In this project we use time domain analysis to investigate some interesting features of some music tracks. These include, loudness, zero-crossing, windowing and spectral leaking, spectral centroids and spreads, spectral flatness, and spectral flux. We also go into some analysis of psychoacoustics such as a human's perception of frequencies and assigning these frequencies to a filterbank to use for future projects to analyse these music tracks further.
