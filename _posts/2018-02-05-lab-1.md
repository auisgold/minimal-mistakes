# Introduction
In this project we use time domain analysis to investigate some interesting features of some music tracks. These include loudness and zero-crossing. We will found that these features are useful for identifying classical and jazz music tracks as they vary in loudness and noise with multiple instruments and changing volumes, but not quite so for other genres of music. In future projects we will look at other time domain features to see if we can identify other genres of music with those.

## Main Project

1. **Introduction** 

With the availability of a large amount of digital music, there is an important need to be able to invent tools that can search and organize all this music. Companies have applications that can recognize songs based solely on the music.  
This goal of this lab will be explore some of the digital signal processing techniques to automatically extract features that characterize music.  

2. **Audio signal: from the sound to the wav file** 

The current standard for high quality audio and DVD is a sampling frequency of fs = 96kHz, and a 24-bit depth for the quantization. The CD quality is 16 bit sampled at fs = 44.1 kHz.  

	1. Dolphins can only hears sounds over the frequency range [7-120] 
	kHz. At what sampling frequency fs should we sample digital audio 
	signals for dolphins? 
	
	The Nyquist theorem states that in order to accurately sample 
	a maximum frequency of fs/2, we must use a sampling frequency 
	of fs. This means that we must use a sampling frequency of 
	240 kHz. As it is stated above, DVDs have a sampling 
	frequency of 96 kHz which won’t for dolphins. 
	While there are likely other technologies that have 
	a sampling frequency of 240 kHz, they are likely not cost 
	effective, so it is not viable to share the sounds of 
	dolphins with the typical consumer until better recording 
	standards are developed. 

	2. **Segments, Frames, Samples**
   	In order to automatically analyze the music, the audio 
	files are segmented into non overlapping segments of a 
	few seconds. This provides the coarsest resolution for 
	the analysis. The audio features are computed at a 
	much finer resolution. The audio file is divided into 
	frames of a few milliseconds over which the analysis is 
	conducted. In some cases the frames may be chosen to overlap, 
	whereas in other cases they will not. In this lab the audio 
	files are sampled at fs = 11, 050 Hz, and we consider intervals 
	of size N = 512 samples, or 46 ms. This interval of 46 milliseconds 
	is called a frame. We will implement several algorithms that will 
	return a set of features for each frame. While there are 512 samples 
	per frame, we will usually return a feature vector of much smaller size. 
   
3. **The Music**
Music being analyzed is from six different musical genres and are chosen as they are diverse and also have interesting characteristics. 	
	
	1. Write a MATLAB function that extracts T seconds of music from a given track. You will use the MATLAB function audioread to 		read a track and the functions audioplayer and play (or playblocking) to listen to the track. In the lab you will use T =24 		seconds and start at the sample halfway through each track to compare the different algorithms. Download the files, and test 		your function.
	
	```
	function [soundExtract,p] = extractSound(filename, time) 
	info = audioinfo(filename); 
	[song, ~] = audioread(filename); 
	if time >= info.Duration     
		soundExtract = song;     
		p = audioplayer(soundExtract,info.SampleRate);     
		return; 
	elseif time <= 1/info.SampleRate    
		error('Too small of a time to sample'); 
	end 
	samples = time*info.SampleRate; 			
	soundExtract = song(floor(info.TotalSamples/2)-floor(samples/2):1: ... 
    	floor(info.TotalSamples/2)+floor(samples/2)); 
	p = audioplayer(soundExtract, info.SampleRate); 
	end
	```
	
	The MATLAB function uses the built-in audioinfo function which provides all the features for this function to extract the number 	 of samples needed from any .wav file. 
	
4. **Low level features: time domain analysis**

The most interesting features will involve some sophisticated spectral analysis. There are however a few simple features that can be directly computed in the time domain, we describe some of the most popular features in the following. 

	1. Assignment: Implement the loudness and ZCR and evaluate these 
	features on the different music tracks. The frames should be non 
	overlapping. Your MATLAB function should display each feature as 
	a time series in a separate figure (see e.g. Fig. 1). 
	
	2. Assignment: Comment on the specificity of the feature, and its 
	ability to separate different musical genre. The most interesting 
	features will involve some sophisticated spectral analysis. There 
	are however a few simple features that can be directly computed in 
	the time domain, we describe some of the most popular features in the 
	following. 
	
	3. Loudness
	The standard deviation of the original audio signal x[n] computed over 
	a frame of size N provides a sense of the loudness, 
	
![Equation1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation1.PNG)

	The following is the loudness function which uses the extractSound function 
	from before and splits the song into frames of size 255 overlapped halfway 
	with the previous frame: 
	
	```
	function [loudness_data] = loudness(filename, varargin) 
	%Computes the standard deviation of the original audio divided 
	%into frames of size 255 loudness(filename,[franeSize,time,plotBool]) 
  	switch nargin     
	case 1         
		frameSize=512;         
		time=24;         
		plotBool=1;     
	case 2         
		frameSize=varargin{1};         
		time=24;         
		plotBool=1;     
	case 3 
        	frameSize=varargin{1};         
		time=varargin{2};         
		plotBool=1;     
	case 4 
        	frameSize=varargin{1};         
		time=varargin{2};         
		plotBool=varargin{3};     
	otherwise 
        	error('loudness:argChk', 'Wrong number of input arguments'); 
	end 
	[y,~]=extractSound( filename, time ); 
	frames_data = buffer(y,frameSize,ceil(frameSize/2)); 
	loudness_data=std(frames_data,0,1); 
	if plotBool==1     
		p=plot(1:length(loudness_data),loudness_data(1,:));     
		title(['Loudness per frame: "' filename '"']);     
		xlim([0 length(loudness_data)+1]);     
		xlabel('Frame Number');     
		ylabel('Loudness'); 
    		saveas(p,['Loudness_' filename(1:end-4) '.png']); 
	end 
	end          
	
	The following is a plot of the loudness of “track201-classical.wav”. 
	The figure shows that the song starts off loud and then becomes quiet, 
	with two decently loud sections in between and becoming pretty soft at 
	the end. Other loudness plots can be found at the end of the report in 
	the figures section.

	4. Zero-crossing
	The Zero Crossing Rate is the average number of times the audio signal crosses 
	the zero amplitude line per time unit. The ZCR is related to the pitch height, 
	and is also correlated to the noisiness of the signal. We use the following 
	definition of ZCR,
	
![Equation2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation2.PNG)
	
	Note that to ensure that each frame’s ZCR rate can be computed independently of 
	that of other frames, the lower index in the summation is one larger than it is 
	for the standard deviation. Below is my MATLAB implementation of the zero crossing 
	rate, similar to the loudness function it takes the middle 24 seconds of a track and 
	stores it into frames of size 255.  
	
	```
	function [ ZCR_data ] = zeroCross( filename ) 
	%zeroCross Computes the zero cross rate of an audio file 
	%   The Zero Crossing Rate is the average number of times the audio signal 
	%   crosses the zero amplitude line per time unit 
	frameSize=512; 
	time=24; 
	[y,~]=extractSound( filename, time ); % Operate on middle 24 seconds 
	frames_data = buffer(y,frameSize,ceil(frameSize/2)); 
	ZCR_data=zeros(1,length(frames_data)); 
	ZCR_data(1:end)=sum(abs(diff(frames_data(1:end,:))))/length(frames_data);   
	p=plot(1:length(ZCR_data),ZCR_data(1,:)); 
	title(['ZCR per frame: "' filename '"']); 
	xlim([0 length(ZCR_data)+1]); xlabel('Frame Number'); 
	ylabel('ZCR per frame'); 
	saveas(p,['ZCR_' filename(1:end-4) '.png']); 
	end
	```
	
	This is a plot of the ZCR function applied to “track201-classical.wav”. The 
	shape is pretty similar to the loudness plot, however the ZCR determines how 
	noisy a track is instead. Other ZCR plots can be found in the figures section 
	at the end of the report.  

![Figure2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure2.PNG)

	Just like the loudness function, the ZCR is useful in identifying classical and 
	jazz music. There doesn’t seem to be any clear advantages in using one function 
	over the other and needs to be tested with much more music to see the potential 
	advantages of one function over the other.
