# Introduction
In this project we use time domain analysis to investigate some interesting features of some music tracks. These include, loudness, zero-crossing, windowing and spectral leaking, spectral centroids and spreads, spectral flatness, and spectral flux. We also go into some analysis of psychoacoustics such as a human's perception of frequencies and assigning these frequencies to a filterbank to use for future projects to analyse these music tracks further.

## Main Project

1. **Introduction** 

With the availability of a large amount of digital music, there is an important need to be able to invent tools that can search and organize all this music. Companies have applications that can recognize songs based solely on the music.  
This goal of this lab will be explore some of the digital signal processing techniques to automatically extract features that characterize music.  

2. **Audio signal: from the sound to the wav file** 

The current standard for high quality audio and DVD is a sampling frequency of fs = 96kHz, and a 24-bit depth for the quantization. The CD quality is 16 bit sampled at fs = 44.1 kHz.  

	1. Dolphins can only hears sounds over the frequency range [7-120] 
	kHz. At what sampling frequency fs should we sample digital audio 
	signals for dolphins? 
	
	The Nyquist theorem states that in order to accurately sample 
	a maximum frequency of fs/2, we must use a sampling frequency 
	of fs. This means that we must use a sampling frequency of 
	240 kHz. As it is stated above, DVDs have a sampling 
	frequency of 96 kHz which wonâ€™t for dolphins. 
	While there are likely other technologies that have 
	a sampling frequency of 240 kHz, they are likely not cost 
	effective, so it is not viable to share the sounds of 
	dolphins with the typical consumer until better recording 
	standards are developed. 

	2. **Segments, Frames, Samples**
   	In order to automatically analyze the music, the audio 
	files are segmented into non overlapping segments of a 
	few seconds. This provides the coarsest resolution for 
	the analysis. The audio features are computed at a 
	much finer resolution. The audio file is divided into 
	frames of a few milliseconds over which the analysis is 
	conducted. In some cases the frames may be chosen to overlap, 
	whereas in other cases they will not. In this lab the audio 
	files are sampled at fs = 11, 050 Hz, and we consider intervals 
	of size N = 512 samples, or 46 ms. This interval of 46 milliseconds 
	is called a frame. We will implement several algorithms that will 
	return a set of features for each frame. While there are 512 samples 
	per frame, we will usually return a feature vector of much smaller size. 
   
3. **The Music**
Music being analyzed is from six different musical genres and are chosen as they are diverse and also have interesting characteristics. 	
	
	1. Write a MATLAB function that extracts T seconds of music from a given track. You will use the MATLAB function audioread to 		read a track and the functions audioplayer and play (or playblocking) to listen to the track. In the lab you will use T =24 		seconds and start at the sample halfway through each track to compare the different algorithms. Download the files, and test 		your function.
	
	```
	function [soundExtract,p] = extractSound(filename, time) 
	info = audioinfo(filename); 
	[song, ~] = audioread(filename); 
	if time >= info.Duration     
		soundExtract = song;     
		p = audioplayer(soundExtract,info.SampleRate);     
		return; 
	elseif time <= 1/info.SampleRate    
		error('Too small of a time to sample'); 
	end 
	samples = time*info.SampleRate; 			
	soundExtract = song(floor(info.TotalSamples/2)-floor(samples/2):1: ... 
    	floor(info.TotalSamples/2)+floor(samples/2)); 
	p = audioplayer(soundExtract, info.SampleRate); 
	end
	```
	
	The MATLAB function uses the built-in audioinfo function which provides all the features for this function to extract the number 	 of samples needed from any .wav file. 
	
4. **Low level features: time domain analysis**

The most interesting features will involve some sophisticated spectral analysis. There are however a few simple features that can be directly computed in the time domain, we describe some of the most popular features in the following. 

	1. Assignment: Implement the loudness and ZCR and evaluate these features on the different music tracks. The frames should be 		non overlapping. Your MATLAB function should display each feature as a time series in a separate figure (see e.g. Fig. 1). 
	
	2. Assignment: Comment on the specificity of the feature, and its ability to separate different musical genre.

	3. Loudness
	The standard deviation of the original audio signal x[n] computed over a frame of size N provides a sense of the loudness,
