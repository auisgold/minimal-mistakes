# Introduction
In this project we implement the mp3 standard and look at how different compression ratios affect sound quality of a specific piece of music. This algorithm is frequently used to retain the salient features of music tracks, but decrease size so people can download and listen to their tracks in a reasonable amount of time.

# Main Project

## 1. Intro

In this lab we are investigating the features of Layer III of MPEGG 1, also known as mp3. We will first develop several subband filters to decompose and reconstruct the original audio signal. We will then be using a polyphaser pseudo Quadrature Mirror Filter to deconstruct and eventually reconstruct the original audio signal.  
This is a practice used to reduce the amount of space a certain song takes up on a hard drive while not compromising too much on the original audio signal. This is helpful for cloud based audio options such as Pandora or Spotify, as they have a lot of data to process from the hundred of thousands of songs in their libraries.  
 
## 2. Cosine Modulated Pseudo Quadrature Mirror Filter: Analysis 

In this section we give the detailed mathematical description of the analysis filter banks. We will manipulate the equations that combine convolution and decimation to arrive at a fast algorithm to compute the output signal, s<sub>k</sub>, for each of the 32 subbands. In section 2.1 we further describe the algorithmic implementation. 
Consider the 512 tap filter h<sub>k</sub>; the output of the combined filtering and decimation for this filter is given by 

![Equation41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-1.PNG)

where

![Equation42]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-2.PNG)

and p<sub>0</sub> is a prototype lowpass filter. The frequency response of h<sub>k</sub> is clear: the modulation of p<sub>0</sub>[m] by

![Equation43]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-3.PNG)
shifts the lowpass filter’s frequency response to be centered around the frequency (2k+1)π/64, and thus h<sub>k</sub> will become
a bandpass filter that selects frequencies around (2k +1)π/64, for k = 0,...31, with a nominal bandwidth of π/32. 

This requires 32 × 512 = 16,384 combined multiplications and additions to compute the 32 outputs s1, …, s32 for each block  of 32 samples of the incoming signal x. In the following, we develop a faster algorithm to compute this operation. 
We start with 

![Equation41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-1.PNG) 

and decompose the summation as follows (think of this as letting m = 64q + r): 

![Equation44]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-4.PNG) 

Next, we observe that since 

![Equation45]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-5.PNG) 

we can write 

![Equation46]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-6.PNG) 

Let us define, 

![Equation47]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-7.PNG) 

then 

![Equation48]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-8.PNG) 

Using the notations of the standard, we further define 

![Equation49]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-9.PNG) 

then

![Equation410]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-10.PNG) 

and 

![Equation411]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-11.PNG)

As a result of expressing the convolution of

![Equation41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-1.PNG)

in the form of equation 

![Equation411]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-11.PNG)

 we can efficiently compute the sub band samples. For every n, we use the following three steps
 
 First, compute: 
 
![Equation412]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-12.PNG)
 
 Next, sum out the dependency on q via:
 
![Equation413]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-13.PNG)

Finally, compute one sample output for each subscribed via:

![Equation414]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-14.PNG)

This algorithm requires 2,560 multiplications and 2464 additions, but further speedup can be obtained using a fast DCT algorithm to compute matrix-vector multiplication.  

	Assignment 
	1. Write the MATLAB pqmf that implements the 
	analysis filter bank described above. The 
	function will have the following template: 
 
         [coefficients] = pqmf (input)  
 
         where input is a buffer that contains an 
	 integer number of frames of audio data. The 
	 output array coefficients has the same size 
	 as the buffer input, and contains the subband 
	 coefficients.  
 
	The array coefficients should be organized in the following manner: 
 
 	coefficients =  [S<sub>0</sub>[0]… S
	<sub>0</sub>[Ns – 1]  ...S<sub>31</sub>[0] ... 
	S<sub>31</sub>[Ns -1]] (22) where Si[k] is 
	the coefficient from subband i = 0,...,31 
	computed for the packet k of 32 audio samples. 
	Also NS is the total number of packets of 
	32 samples: 
 
 
	The organization of coefficients is such that the 
	low frequencies come first, and then the next 
	higher frequencies, and so on and so forth. 
 
	2. Analyze the first 5 seconds of the following tracks, and display the array coefficients, 
 
	sample1.wav,sample2.wav 
	sine1.wav,sine2.wav  
	handel.wav 
	cast.wav 
	gilberto.wav 
 
	Comment on the visual content of the arrays coefficients. 
 
 1. MATLAB code of the implementation of the pqmf function can be found below:
 
 ```

%PQMF implements the analysis filter bank 
%Takes an input "inputBuffer" that contains an number of frames 
%of audio data. The output array "coefficients" as the same size  
%as the buffer "inputBuffer", and contains the subband coefficients   
filenameFlag = 0; 
if(ischar(inputBuffer))     
	filenameFlag = 1;     
	filename = inputBuffer;     
	info = audioinfo(filename);     
	SampleTime = 5;     
	if(SampleTime > info.Duration)        
		SampleTime = info.Duration;    
	end     
	inputBuffer = audioread(filename, [1,(info.SampleRate*SampleTime)]);     
	inputBuffer = inputBuffer(find(inputBuffer~=0,1):end); 
end

end
```

2. Below are the coefficients of sample1.wav. It can be seen the lower end of the PQMF coefficients are low, while they get larger as it approaches 5000. Listening to the song, this makes sense as the piano lacks a substantial bass, but higher pitches are heard very easily. 

![Figure41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure4-1.PNG)

## 3. Cosine Modulated Pseudo Quadrature Mirror Filter: Synthesis 

The synthesis, or reconstruction, from the coefficients is performed in a very similar manner. The following equations yield the reconstruction of 32 audio samples from 32 subband coefficients 

for i = 1023 down to 64 do

v[i] = v[i − 64] 
 
for i = 63 down to 0 do 

![Equation415]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-15.PNG)

for i = 0 to 7 do 

for j = 0 to 31 do 

u[64 i + j]= v[128 i + j] 

u[64 i + j + 32] = v[128 i + j + 96] 

for i = 0 to 511 do 

w[i] = d[i] u[i], 

for j = 0 to 31 do 

![Equation416]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-16.PNG)

where 

![Equation417]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/equation4-17.PNG)

	Assignment 
	3. Write the MATLAB function ipqmf that implements 
	the synthesis filter bank described in the equations 
	above. The function will have the following template: 
	
	[recons] = ipqmf (coefficients) 
	
	where coefficients is a buffer that contains the 
	coefficients computed by pqmf. The output array 
	recons has the same size as the buffer coefficients, 
	and contains the reconstructed audio data. 
	
	4. Reconstruct the first 5 seconds of the following 
	tracks, and display the signal input. You should 
	observe that the reconstructed signal is slightly 
	delayed. This is due to the fact that the processing 
	assumes that a buffer of 512 audio samples is 
	immediately available. 
	sample1.wav 
	sample2.wav  
	sine1.wav
	sine2.wav
	handle.wav 
	cast.wav 
	gilberto.wav 
	
	5. Compute the maximum error between the reconstructed
	signal and the original, taking into account the delay. 
	The error should be no more than 10-5. Explain how
	you estimate the delay.

4. The reconstruction of sample1.wav is shown below. As it can be seen there are some issues with the reconstruction, but the general form seems to follow that of the original audio. After looking at the results it can be seen there are slight differences in the pqmf plots. There seems to be a slight delay between the original signal and reconstruction using this method.

![Figure42]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure4-2.PNG)

5. Calculation of the error can be found below as well as code to compile the entire lab:

While I tried to use a mathematical way for computing this delay, it eventually was just easier to visually look at the delay in the pqmf plots to compute the error.

	Assignment 
	6. Modify your code to reconstruct an audio signal 
	using only a subset of bands. This is the beginning 
	of compression. Your function prototype should look 
	like this: 
	
	[recons] = ipqmf (coefficients, thebands) 
	
	where thebands is an array of 32 integers, such that 
	thebands[i] =1 if band i is used in the reconstruction, 
	and thebands[i] = 0 if band i is not used. Experiment 
	with the files
	 sample1.wav, sample2.wav 
	 sine1.wav, sine2.wav
	 handel.wav 
	 cast.wav 
	 gilberto.wav 
	 
	 and describe the outcome of the experiments, when certain 
	 bands are not used to reconstruct. If you define the 
	 compression ratio as 
	number of bands used to reconstruct/32  
	explain what is a good compression ratio, and a good choice 
	of bands for each audio sample. Note that the psychoacoustic 
	model of MP3 performs this task automatically. 
	
6. After modifying my ipqmf function that can be found earlier in this section,  I used bands 1 through 7 and computed the reconstruction. Interestingly, the error did not change much when looking at the figures below. This means that the reconstruction is not great and we are unable to get better results with this method of reconstruction. Further improvements could lead to better results. The compression rate being used right now is 6:32, which could be considered good, but doesn’t really matter as the output is incorrect with this implementation. 

It would be more beneficial to use more bands, but the compression would not be as ideal as not as much storage space would be saved, and it could just be better to use the original audio.

![Figure43]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/figure4-3.PNG)

## 4. Conclusion

With this lab, we were able to analyze the Cosine Quadrature Mirror Filter and see how to implement mp3. While the reconstruction wasn’t ideal, further improvements could be made in order to create a reconstruction with an acceptable compression rate. Even though this would not be used in practice, it was a good start into creating a reconstruction of an original audio track that uses less space.
