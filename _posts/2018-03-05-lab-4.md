In this project we implement the mp3 standard and look at how different compression ratios affect sound quality of a specific piece of music. This algorithm is frequently used to retain the salient features of music tracks, but decrease size so people can download and listen to their tracks in a reasonable amount of time. To see more details of the project click <a href="http://boulderpogoraids.tk/Tao_Jesse_Lab4">here</a>. Sample Matlab .wav files were used to implement the algorithm so no additional files are needed.
