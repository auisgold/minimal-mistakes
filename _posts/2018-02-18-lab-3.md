## Introduction
In this project we use 150 songs with 6 different genres to compare and try to classify certain tracks as certain genres. This process is similar to what apps like Spotify do to classify a large library of songs into certain genres. For this we use features such as MFCC, filter banks, rhythm, and tonality to create a classifier.
