In this project we look at how similar certain seconds in a music track are to each other, as well as look into the rhythm and chroma of a certain music track. We will use these features in a future project to compare two music tracks to see if they are part of the same genre of music using this analysis. To see more details of the project click <a href="http://boulderpogoraids.tk/Tao_Jesse_Lab2">here</a>. Feel free to use any audio files to test this out.
