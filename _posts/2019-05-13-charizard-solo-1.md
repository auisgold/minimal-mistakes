## Pokemon Go Solos
This is a video of me doing a Charizard solo using all Rampardos. This is currently the only Pokemon you can use in Pokemon Go in order to
solo Charizard. Breakpoint is level 33-34 depending on the attack stat, but I have all of mine powered up to lvl 40 except for the last one
I use which is powered up to lvl 39 to ensure the best possible time, which as you will see here is 19s, when the run button dissappears.
