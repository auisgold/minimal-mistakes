# Introduction
In this project we use Fourier transforms, power specs, peak power, and chroma shifting to create a different type of classifier to identify the genre of music tracks.

# Main Project

## Part 1

Below are the figures generated using the function with the Hann window. The code used to generate the plots is found in the appendix at the end of the report. Comments on the results of each track for the stft are given above each figure. Comments for the rest of the figures in the report will also use the Hann window. Stft takes in the sampled signal as well as which window will be used. The Hann window in the case of this report, but the Kaiser and Blackman window could be used as well by changing the second argument of the function. The function produces a time-frequency matrix where each column of the matrix is the frequency response of 1024 sample section of a song, and the sections overlap by 768 samples each. All songs are analyzed individually in the following section. 

For track201-classical.wav we can see that there are many different notes being played which makes sense as this is piece is better known as Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor by Bach. This makes sense for a concerto, as the definition of a concerto is a musical piece where there is a main instrument, which in this case is a violin, accompanied by an orchestra which can include many different instruments. It can be seen that the main spots of red at lower frequencies is likely the steady beat and harmony that can be heard from the cello, while the higher frequencies are the melodies of the first set of violins and the overtones of the second set of violins. It is also important to note that while it is not as noticeable to the ear, the chart shows as slight decrease in frequency as time goes on which can likely be attributed to the nature of string instruments as the vibrations caused between the string and the bow can cause the string to loosen, thus generating lower frequencies than intended.

In track204-classical.wav, the melody can be clearly seen as there is only one instrument playing which is a piano. As this is just a standard etude (practice exercise) the track follows a very standard pattern of increasing frequencies and then decreasing frequencies. We can see some spikes in frequency as the etude isnâ€™t completely boring and does scale up to some harmonics of the same note. The main takeaway is that it is easy figure out the melody of a song when there is only one instrument and the structure is very regimented as this etude is designed for a pianist to practice their arpeggios (set of notes played in an increasing frequency and then decreasing frequency corresponding to the intended melody for a song).
