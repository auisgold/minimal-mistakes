This is my site where I post all my work with Digital Signal Processing. It includes some cool work with music and image files as well as some machine learning done in MATLAB.
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer that loves messing around with audio and image files in MATLAB, experimenting with machine learning and digital filters.

My hobbies include playing Pokemon Go, playing piano and violin, and swimming. These things may be mentioned here in addtion to all my Digital Signal Processing work.
